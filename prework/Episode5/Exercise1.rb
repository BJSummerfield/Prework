# Exercise: Complete the comments below to keep track of what red, green, and blue are at all times:

red = 3             # red is 3, green doesn't exist, blue doesn't exist
blue = 8            # red is 3, green doesn't exist, blue is 8
green = red + blue  # red is 3, green is 11, blue is 8
red = blue + green  # red is 19, green is 11, blue is 8
green = blue - blue # red is 19, green is 0 , blue is 8
red = blue / green  # red is 0, green is 0, blue is 8
blue = red * green  # red is 0, green is 0, blue is 0
red = green + 2     # red is 2, green is 0, blue is 0
blue = red * 2      # red is 2, green is 0, blue is 4
green = blue * red  # red is 2, green is 8, blue is 4
red = green - blue  # red is 4, green is 8, blue is 4
green = red * green # red is 4, green is 32, blue is 4
