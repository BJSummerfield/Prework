    return "Reading Rainbow!
            Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high
            Take a look, it's in a book,
            A Reading Rainbow!
            I can go anywhere
            Friends to know, and ways to grow
            A Reading Rainbow!

            I can be anything 
            Take a look, it's in a book
            A Reading Rainbow
            Reading Rainbow!
            Ooooooooooh"
